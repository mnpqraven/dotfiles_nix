# Scroll
#
# You can change how many lines are scrolled each time by setting this option.
#
# Scroll calculation for canonical mode will be based on `lines = (accumulated scroll * multiplier / divider)`,
# If you want a quicker scroll, keep increasing the multiplier.
# If you want to reduce scroll speed you will need to increase the divider.
# You can use both properties also to find the best scroll for you.
#
# Multiplier default is 3.0.
# Divider default is 1.0.
# Example:
# [scroll]
# multiplier = 3.0
# divider = 1.0

# Navigation

# "clickable" - Enable click on tabs to switch.
# "use-current-path" - Use same path whenever a new tab is created (Note: requires `use-fork` to be set to false).
# "color-automation" - Set a specific color for the tab whenever a specific program is running, or in a specific directory.
#
# Example:
# [navigation]
# mode = "bookmark"
# clickable = false
# hide-if-single = true
# use-current-path = false
# color-automation = []

# Colors
#
# Colors definition will overwrite any property in theme
# (considering if theme folder does exists and is being used)
#
# Example:

# Example:
# [bindings]
# keys = [
#   { key = "q", with = "super", action = "Quit" },
#   # Bytes[27, 91, 53, 126] is equivalent to "\x1b[5~"
#   { key = "home", with = "super | shift", bytes = [27, 91, 53, 126] }
# ]
